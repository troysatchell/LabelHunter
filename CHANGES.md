# Changes

Per-ticket changelog. Every factory PR adds an entry at the top naming its ticket ID(s):
what changed, how to run it, how to roll it back. The gate greps for the ticket ID with
anchored boundaries — `TRO-30` will not match inside `TRO-301`.

## FACTORY — labelhunter factory build (2026-08-10)

**What changed.** Stood up the ticket factory: `factory/` (config, quarantine baseline,
scorecard, review ledger), `scripts/factory/` (gate, worktree provisioner, testdiff,
review-ledger, status), the `labelhunter-factory` orchestrator skill with its references
(agent contract, escalation incl. CP-1/2/3, triage, lessons), CI workflow, and the ticket
decomposition in `factory/tickets.md` mirrored to Linear project **LabelHunter**.

**How to run it.** `node scripts/factory/status.mjs` for state;
`scripts/factory/worktree.sh TRO-<n> <branch>` to provision;
`scripts/factory/gate.sh` inside a worktree to gate. The orchestrator loop is
`.claude/skills/labelhunter-factory/SKILL.md`.

**Rollback.** Delete `factory/`, `scripts/factory/`, `.claude/skills/labelhunter-factory/`,
and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; archive the Linear project. No application code is touched —
none exists yet.

**Known limits.** The gate is UNVERIFIED pre-scaffold (`factory/config.yaml` → `verification`);
nothing merges on gate evidence until the scaffold ticket runs the verification checks.
