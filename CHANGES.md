# Changes

Per-ticket changelog. Every factory PR adds an entry at the top naming its ticket ID(s):
what changed, how to run it, how to roll it back. The gate greps for the ticket ID with
anchored boundaries — `TRO-30` will not match inside `TRO-301`.

## TRO-457 — PR review round 2: CodeRabbit findings, 1 fixed, 1 stale (2026-08-10)

**What changed.** GitHub-App CodeRabbit reviewed PR #2 (a separate pass from the local CLI
triage already recorded below). Of 5 findings, 3 were already fixed by earlier commits in this
PR and auto-marked resolved. Of the remaining 2:
- `src/lib/db/seed.ts` (minor, real): the batch fixture's counters claimed `totalCount: 2` with
  one auto-verified item, but only one application row is actually batch-linked. Fixed by
  setting the counters to match the single real fixture (`totalCount: 1, autoVerifiedCount: 0,
  needsHumanCount: 1`) rather than inventing a second row. Verified by truncating and re-running
  `pnpm db:seed`, then querying `batch_jobs` and counting batch-linked `applications` directly.
- `src/lib/db/seed.ts` (flagged critical — "transaction callback not closed, file won't parse"):
  verified against the current file and it is **stale**. The finding describes an intermediate
  commit; the fix (wrapping every insert in one `db.transaction()`) already landed and is
  described in the CodeRabbit-triage section below. `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`, and this
  gate's own `typecheck` check all confirm the file parses and type-checks cleanly. Dismissed
  with this reason, not fixed (there was nothing to fix).

**How to run it.** `pnpm db:seed` — same command, corrected counters.

**Rollback.** `git revert` this commit.

## TRO-457 — LH-002: Database schema + migrations (2026-08-10)

**What changed.** Added the real Drizzle + Postgres schema for LabelHunter (PRD §3.6,
TH-R6, TH-R22) in `src/lib/db/`, extending the scaffold's `_meta`-only `schema.ts`:

- **`enums.ts`** — the eight closed-set vocabularies as `pgEnum` types, each backed by one
  `as const` array so the TypeScript union, the Postgres enum, and a runtime guard all stay
  in sync: `beverage_type` (beer/wine/spirits), `label_verdict` (PASS/FAIL/REVIEW),
  `field_verdict` (MATCH/MISMATCH/NEEDS_REVIEW), `field_name` (the 5 example fields from
  PRD §2), `review_reason` (the 8-value `ReviewReason` enum from PRD §3.3, verbatim),
  `resolution_path` (which model(s) resolved a verification), `batch_job_status`, and
  `review_disposition`. `toReviewReason` and `toBeverageType` narrow an untyped string to
  the matching type or throw, naming every legal value in the error — the checkpoint
  between loosely-typed input (model output, a CSV cell) and an insert. TDD: red-first
  tests in `enums.test.ts` (9 cases) cover valid values, invalid values, and a near-miss
  (wrong case) for each guard.
- **`schema.ts`** — six product tables: `batch_jobs` (status + per-item counters the
  batch-progress UI polls), `applications` (brand/class/ABV+proof/net contents/beverage
  type — the claimed values a label gets checked against), `label_images` (storage
  reference, original filename, post-preprocessing dimensions; linked to an application
  for single-label verify or to a batch job before per-row pairing, per PRD §3.5), `verifications` (one row per completed label-level result: verdict, which model(s)
  resolved it, links to application/image/batch job), `field_results` (one row per field
  per verification: extracted value, verbatim evidence — required, not optional, per
  PRD §3.2 — confidence 0–1, verdict, one-line reason), and `review_queue` (one row per
  needs-human item: reason, nullable resolver output, nullable human disposition). Every
  closed-set column uses a Postgres enum, not free text. Reasonable indexes throughout,
  including a partial index on `review_queue` for the unresolved-items view the review
  queue UI needs, and a foreign key on every reference — all `ON DELETE CASCADE` (a
  prototype has no retention requirement, and a child row is meaningless without its
  parent). Full `relations()` graph for the query API.
- **No PII, checked column by column (TH-R6).** No table anywhere stores a real person's
  name, email, address, or other identifier. `review_queue` in particular records a
  human's approve/reject disposition and when, but not who — adding a reviewer-identity
  column was considered and rejected; nothing in the PRD or the rubric asks for it, and
  it would be the one clear PII risk in this schema.
- **Migration** `drizzle/migrations/0001_product_schema.sql`, generated with
  `pnpm db:generate` (not hand-written), applied with `pnpm db:migrate`, and verified with
  direct `psql` queries against this worktree's own database: `\dt` lists all 7 tables,
  `\d <table>` for each of the 6 new ones shows the expected columns, indexes, and
  constraints, and manual negative inserts confirm each constraint fires (the
  `label_images` ownership `CHECK`, the `field_results` confidence-range `CHECK`, the
  `field_results` and `review_queue` unique indexes) — not just declared, but load-bearing.
- **`db:seed`** (`pnpm db:seed`, added to `package.json`, run via the new `tsx` dev
  dependency) inserts a small, obviously-fake dev dataset spanning all six tables: one
  batch job, three applications (a clean single-label PASS, a batch-paired wine with a
  low-confidence ABV read that lands in the review queue, and a single-label FAIL on a
  title-cased government warning — Jenny's real catch, PRD §3.4), three label images,
  three verifications, fifteen field results, and one review-queue entry. Refuses to run
  twice against the same database instead of silently duplicating fixtures.

**A real drizzle-kit bug found and fixed, in scope for this ticket.** The first generated
migration created all 7 tables but zero `CREATE TYPE` statements, even though every enum
column referenced a type name that did not yet exist — an unusable migration that would
fail on apply. Cause: `drizzle-kit generate` only discovers `pgEnum`/`pgTable` objects
that are visible on the configured schema file's own exports; the enums lived in
`enums.ts` and were only imported (not re-exported) by `schema.ts`, so drizzle-kit's
export scan never saw them, even though the tables used them. Fixed with
`export * from "./enums"` in `schema.ts`. Caught by reading the generated SQL before
trusting it (this repo's "claims carry provenance" rule) — a `pnpm db:migrate` exit code
of 0 would have hidden this, since the broken migration was never applied.

**CodeRabbit review triage (6 findings; 5 fixed, 1 explicitly skipped):**
- `enums.test.ts` claimed a wrong-case test for both guards but only had one. Fixed —
  added the missing `toBeverageType("Beer")` case; the claim is now true.
- `review_queue`: added a `CHECK` requiring `disposition` and `disposed_at` to be null or
  non-null together — one fact, two columns, must move as a pair.
- `batch_jobs`: added `CHECK` constraints — every counter non-negative, and each of
  `processedCount`/`autoVerifiedCount`/`resolvedBySonnetCount`/`needsHumanCount`/
  `failedCount` no greater than `totalCount`. Bounded independently, not summed to equal
  `totalCount`: the batch worker (LH-041) updates one counter at a time, and a sum
  constraint would reject a legal state between two separate `UPDATE`s.
- `batch_jobs`/`verifications`/`review_queue`: `updatedAt` now carries `.$onUpdate(() =>
  new Date())`. This is a drizzle-orm runtime default, not a database trigger — it fires
  on every `db.update()` call that does not set the column itself, verified against the
  real database (an `UPDATE` through Drizzle bumped `updated_at` and left `created_at`
  unchanged). It does not protect a write that bypasses the ORM; documented as a known
  limit in the column comment rather than built out further, since every write path in
  this app goes through Drizzle.
- `seed.ts`: wrapped every insert in one `db.transaction()`. A failure partway through now
  rolls back the whole batch instead of leaving a half-seeded database that would silently
  defeat the "already seeded" guard on the next run.
- **Skipped:** enforcing that a verification's application, image, and batch job all
  belong to the same batch. A real DB-level guarantee needs a trigger or composite foreign
  keys spanning three tables — real design work that belongs with the code that creates
  verification rows (LH-041's batch worker, behind the CP-3 batch-queue checkpoint), not
  invented ahead of that design in a schema ticket. Flagged in the final ticket report as a
  known gap, not silently dropped.

**How to run it.** `source .factory-env` (or point `DATABASE_URL` at your own Postgres),
then `pnpm db:migrate` to apply `0001_product_schema.sql`, then `pnpm db:seed` for dev
fixtures. `pnpm db:generate` regenerates a migration after a future `schema.ts` edit.

**Rollback.** Drop the six product tables and their enum types (or restore the pre-0001
database from a snapshot) and delete `drizzle/migrations/0001_product_schema.sql` plus its
entry in `drizzle/migrations/meta/_journal.json`. `_meta` and the scaffold are untouched.

**Design calls the PRD left open (flagging for visibility, not asking permission):**
- No per-application government-warning column — the warning subsystem (PRD §3.4) always
  compares extracted text against one fixed statutory string, so there is no per-application
  value to store.
- `label_images` carries both a nullable `application_id` and a nullable `batch_job_id`
  (at least one required, via `CHECK`) rather than a single polymorphic reference — set
  directly for single-label upload, left to `batch_job_id` alone for a batch upload before
  its CSV-row pairing exists.
- `field_name` and beverage-type-driven optionality rules (e.g. ABV optionality per PRD §2)
  are two different things: this ticket enumerates the closed set of field names in the
  schema, but does not implement any optionality *rule* — that logic, and its tests, belong
  to LH-013 (field comparators), which this ticket does not touch.
- Integer identity columns (`generatedAlwaysAsIdentity()`), not `serial` — Postgres's own
  recommended replacement since v10, and pre-empts the identical suggestion CodeRabbit made
  on the TRO-456 scaffold PR for `_meta.id`.

**Known limits / not verified from this ticket.** `db:seed`'s only tested behavior is the
scripted insert path itself (run against a real database, output checked); it has no
Vitest coverage of its own, since it is a sequence of fixture inserts, not a pure function.
The `relations()` graph was verified to type-check and to match the FK structure by
inspection, not by exercising `db.query.*` relational reads end-to-end — no code in this
repo uses that API yet.

## FACTORY — merge-changes.mjs (2026-08-10)

**What changed.** Three tickets in a row (TRO-456 twice, TRO-457) hit the same `CHANGES.md`
merge conflict — every branch adds an entry at the top, so every concurrent merge collides on
the same lines. Per the recurrence-ladder rule in `references/lessons.md` ("3 = build the
mechanical fix"), added `scripts/factory/merge-changes.mjs --check`: parses the file into
whole entries (never line-by-line), checks per-entry fence balance, duplicate headings, and
(with `--expect TICKET`) that a specific ticket's entry survived intact. Wired into `gate.sh`
G7 alongside the existing ticket-ID grep. Negative-tested: a synthetic file with a spliced
fence and one with a duplicated heading both correctly fail; a well-formed file passes.

**How to run it.** `node scripts/factory/merge-changes.mjs --check CHANGES.md` (add
`--expect TRO-nnn` to also confirm one ticket's entry). Runs automatically as part of the gate.

**Rollback.** `git revert` this commit; G7 falls back to the grep-only check.

## TRO-456 — PR review round 2: CodeRabbit findings, 4 fixed (2026-08-10)

**What changed.** GitHub-App CodeRabbit reviewed PR #1 and requested changes. All four inline
findings were real defects in code this PR added; all four are fixed here.
- `playwright.config.ts` (major): read `PORT`/`APP_PORT` straight from `process.env` with no
  `.env.local` loader. A factory worktree works by accident (`.factory-env` exports the
  variable into the shell); a plain checkout following this PR's own "How to run it"
  instructions would silently fall back to port 3000. Added the same `dotenv` load
  `drizzle.config.ts` already uses.
- `src/lib/db/index.ts` (major): the `pg.Pool` had no `error` listener. An idle client that
  loses its connection emits `error` on the pool; with nothing listening, Node treats it as
  unhandled and can crash the process. Added a listener that logs and lets the pool recover.
- `src/lib/db/index.ts` (trivial): `connectionTimeoutMillis` defaulted to 0 (no timeout) on an
  unreachable database. Set to 10s.
- `src/lib/utils/format.ts` (minor): the third rounding-boundary bug in this function — `999.5`
  rounded to `"1000ms"` while `formatDuration(1000)` itself renders `"1.00s"`, because the
  millisecond branch decided its unit on the unrounded value. Rounds once now, before any
  branch. A standing lesson on this pattern is in `references/lessons.md`.

**How to run it.** `pnpm test` — one new case (`formatDuration(999.5)`). No other setup change.

**Rollback.** `git revert` this commit; each fix is independent of the others and of the
original scaffold commits.

## TRO-456 — LH-001: Scaffold Next.js + TS + Vitest + Playwright + Drizzle + CI (2026-08-10)

**What changed.** Stood up the working application scaffold (TH-R13, TH-R18, TH-R19) that
every later LabelHunter ticket builds on:
- **App shell:** Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript, strict mode) under `src/app/`, with a
  placeholder home page and a DB-free liveness route at `src/app/api/health`.
- **Toolchain:** pnpm (`packageManager` pinned), Node >=22. `pnpm typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`),
  `pnpm lint` (real flat-config ESLint — `eslint.config.mjs`, Next's recommended rules +
  `@typescript-eslint`, plus two project rules: no `any`, no unused vars — verified it
  actually catches violations, not a vacuous config), `pnpm build` (`next build`).
- **Tests:** Vitest (`vitest.config.ts`) with one real unit test suite
  (`src/lib/utils/format.test.ts`, 4 cases) proving the runner executes real code. Playwright
  (`playwright.config.ts`) with one e2e spec (`e2e/health.spec.ts`) that builds, boots the app,
  and asserts a 200 from `/api/health`.
- **Database:** Drizzle + `pg`, `drizzle.config.ts`, a scaffold-only `_meta` table
  (`src/lib/db/schema.ts`) and its generated migration (`drizzle/migrations/0000_meta_healthcheck.sql`).
  `pnpm db:generate` / `pnpm db:migrate` (`drizzle-kit generate` / `drizzle-kit migrate`).
  Migration applied to and verified against this worktree's own Postgres database (queried
  directly, not just exit-code-trusted). Ticket LH-002 (TRO-457) extends `schema.ts` with the
  real product tables.
- **Repo layout for later tickets:** `src/server/{router,extractor,resolver,warning}/` and
  `src/worker/` reserved (each has a `.gitkeep` naming the ticket that owns it) per PRD §3.6 —
  no subsystem logic implemented here.
- **`.env.local.example`** documents the required env vars for a plain clone (`DATABASE_URL`,
  `PORT`, and the not-yet-wired `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

**A real toolchain bug found and fixed, in scope for this ticket:** `pnpm run <script> --
<args>` forwards the literal `--` token into the script's argv (unlike `npm`, which strips
it). Vitest's CLI then treats that leading `--` as "everything after this is a positional
test-name filter," so `--reporter=json --outputFile=<path>` — exactly how `scripts/factory/gate.sh`
and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` invoke `pnpm test` — is silently ignored: tests still run, but
no JSON report is ever written. Fixed by routing the `test` script through
`scripts/run-tests.cjs`, a small wrapper that strips one leading `--` before handing argv to
vitest. Confirmed the exact gate invocation (`pnpm test -- --reporter=json
--outputFile=<absolute path>`) now writes a valid report. The same pnpm quirk broke
`pnpm start -- -p <port>` in `playwright.config.ts`'s `webServer.command`; fixed by passing the
port via the `env` option instead (`next start`/`next dev` both honor `PORT`).

**How to run it.** `pnpm install`, then `cp .env.local.example .env.local` and point
`DATABASE_URL` at a running Postgres (or, in a factory worktree, `source .factory-env` — it's
already provisioned). `pnpm db:migrate` to apply migrations, then `pnpm dev` (or `pnpm build &&
pnpm start`) to run the app. `pnpm test` for unit tests, `pnpm test:e2e` for Playwright,
`pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm lint` / `pnpm build` for the rest of the gate.

**Rollback.** `git revert` this ticket's commits on `feat/lh-scaffold` (or delete the branch
before merge). No product code depends on this yet — reverting only removes the scaffold
itself. The worktree's database (`labelhunter_wt_tro_456`) can be dropped and recreated; the
`_meta` table is scaffold-only and holds no data of consequence.

**Known limits / not done here (see final ticket report for detail).** The broader gate
self-verification suite named in `factory/config.yaml`'s `verification:` block (no-op branch
fails, forged break-one/fix-one caught, quarantine-not-widenable-from-branch, `worktree.sh`
run twice in a row, a real CI run on an opened PR) was **not** run from this ticket — it needs
the orchestrator (this agent was told not to edit `factory/config.yaml`, `scripts/factory/gate.sh`,
or `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). This ticket ran `scripts/factory/gate.sh` (no flags) itself and
reports that verdict verbatim.

**Gate bug found, not fixed here (out of scope — see final ticket report).**
`scripts/factory/gate.sh`'s lint-detection line (`if ls eslint.config.* .eslintrc* ...`)
always reports `lint: skip` for a project using only one of the two config styles — `ls`
exits non-zero if *either* glob has no match, even when the other matched a real file. This
repo ships a real, working flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`, verified below) but the gate
still shows `skip`. Not edited per this ticket's instructions (gate.sh is the orchestrator's
file); flagging for a fix there.

**CodeRabbit review triage (3 findings, all addressed or explicitly skipped):**
- `src/lib/utils/format.ts` (minor): `formatDuration` could render `119.6s` as `"1m 60s"`
  instead of `"2m 0s"` (rounding minutes/seconds separately let the remainder hit 60). Fixed —
  round the total once, then derive minutes/remainder from that. Added a regression case.
- `src/app/api/health/route.ts` (trivial): add `Cache-Control: no-store` so a proxy/CDN never
  caches a stale liveness result. Fixed; e2e spec now asserts the header.
- `drizzle/migrations/0000_meta_healthcheck.sql` (trivial): suggested `bigint identity` instead
  of `serial` for `_meta.id`. Skipped — `_meta` is a scaffold-only healthcheck table that LH-002
  replaces with the real schema; not worth a churn migration for a table this ticket doesn't
  expect to survive past the next one.

## FACTORY — gate.sh lint-detection fix (2026-08-10)

**What changed.** `scripts/factory/gate.sh`'s lint-config check used
`ls eslint.config.* .eslintrc*`, which fails if *either* glob has no match — so a repo with
only `eslint.config.mjs` (no `.eslintrc*`) always read as "no config found" and G2 stayed
`skip` forever, even with a real, working lint config in place. Found by the TRO-456 scaffold
agent while gating its own branch. Fixed with `compgen -G`, which tests each pattern on its
own.

**How to run it.** No action needed; the next `scripts/factory/gate.sh` run picks it up.

**Rollback.** `git revert` this commit; the check reverts to always-skip, which is safe
(under-detection, not over-detection) but wrong.

## FACTORY — CLAUDE.md and writing-style rules (2026-08-10)

**What changed.** Added `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root. It orients any agent to the PRD, the
requirements inventory, and the factory. It sets one writing rule for all prose Claude writes
here: follow ASD-STE100 (one meaning per word, active voice, short sentences) and Zinsser's
four principles (simplicity, brevity, clarity, humanity). Updated
`.claude/skills/labelhunter-factory/references/agent-contract.md` to list `CLAUDE.md` as the
first required read, matching the reference factory's own pattern.

**How to run it.** Nothing to run. Every future agent session reads `CLAUDE.md` first.

**Rollback.** Delete `CLAUDE.md`; revert the one-line addition to `agent-contract.md`.

## FACTORY — labelhunter factory build (2026-08-10)

**What changed.** Stood up the ticket factory: `factory/` (config, quarantine baseline,
scorecard, review ledger), `scripts/factory/` (gate, worktree provisioner, testdiff,
review-ledger, status), the `labelhunter-factory` orchestrator skill with its references
(agent contract, escalation incl. CP-1/2/3, triage, lessons), CI workflow, and the ticket
decomposition in `factory/tickets.md` mirrored to Linear project **LabelHunter**.

**How to run it.** `node scripts/factory/status.mjs` for state;
`scripts/factory/worktree.sh TRO-<n> <branch>` to provision;
`scripts/factory/gate.sh` inside a worktree to gate. The orchestrator loop is
`.claude/skills/labelhunter-factory/SKILL.md`.

**Rollback.** Delete `factory/`, `scripts/factory/`, `.claude/skills/labelhunter-factory/`,
and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; archive the Linear project. No application code is touched —
none exists yet.

**Known limits.** The gate is UNVERIFIED pre-scaffold (`factory/config.yaml` → `verification`);
nothing merges on gate evidence until the scaffold ticket runs the verification checks.
