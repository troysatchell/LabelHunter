# Changes

Per-ticket changelog. Every factory PR adds an entry at the top naming its ticket ID(s):
what changed, how to run it, how to roll it back. The gate greps for the ticket ID with
anchored boundaries — `TRO-30` will not match inside `TRO-301`.

## FACTORY — gate.sh lint-detection fix (2026-08-10)

**What changed.** `scripts/factory/gate.sh`'s lint-config check used
`ls eslint.config.* .eslintrc*`, which fails if *either* glob has no match — so a repo with
only `eslint.config.mjs` (no `.eslintrc*`) always read as "no config found" and G2 stayed
`skip` forever, even with a real, working lint config in place. Found by the TRO-456 scaffold
agent while gating its own branch. Fixed with `compgen -G`, which tests each pattern on its
own.

**How to run it.** No action needed; the next `scripts/factory/gate.sh` run picks it up.

**Rollback.** `git revert` this commit; the check reverts to always-skip, which is safe
(under-detection, not over-detection) but wrong.

## FACTORY — CLAUDE.md and writing-style rules (2026-08-10)

**What changed.** Added `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root. It orients any agent to the PRD, the
requirements inventory, and the factory. It sets one writing rule for all prose Claude writes
here: follow ASD-STE100 (one meaning per word, active voice, short sentences) and Zinsser's
four principles (simplicity, brevity, clarity, humanity). Updated
`.claude/skills/labelhunter-factory/references/agent-contract.md` to list `CLAUDE.md` as the
first required read, matching the reference factory's own pattern.

**How to run it.** Nothing to run. Every future agent session reads `CLAUDE.md` first.

**Rollback.** Delete `CLAUDE.md`; revert the one-line addition to `agent-contract.md`.

## FACTORY — labelhunter factory build (2026-08-10)

**What changed.** Stood up the ticket factory: `factory/` (config, quarantine baseline,
scorecard, review ledger), `scripts/factory/` (gate, worktree provisioner, testdiff,
review-ledger, status), the `labelhunter-factory` orchestrator skill with its references
(agent contract, escalation incl. CP-1/2/3, triage, lessons), CI workflow, and the ticket
decomposition in `factory/tickets.md` mirrored to Linear project **LabelHunter**.

**How to run it.** `node scripts/factory/status.mjs` for state;
`scripts/factory/worktree.sh TRO-<n> <branch>` to provision;
`scripts/factory/gate.sh` inside a worktree to gate. The orchestrator loop is
`.claude/skills/labelhunter-factory/SKILL.md`.

**Rollback.** Delete `factory/`, `scripts/factory/`, `.claude/skills/labelhunter-factory/`,
and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; archive the Linear project. No application code is touched —
none exists yet.

**Known limits.** The gate is UNVERIFIED pre-scaffold (`factory/config.yaml` → `verification`);
nothing merges on gate evidence until the scaffold ticket runs the verification checks.
